For starters, neither my boyfriend nor I could notice any sort of enhanced or 'captivating' sensation. What we did notice, however, was the messy consistency that was reminiscent of a more liquid-y vaseline. It was difficult to clean up, and was not a pleasant, especially since it lacked the 'captivating' sensation we had both been expecting. I'm disappointed that I paid as much as I did for a lube that I won't use again, when I could just use their normal personal lubricant for 1) less money and 2) less mess.",Disappointed,,,Rebecca,67981934427,13356,6

I started from bottom to top of my body and got my husband to help with my back just to insure no streaks. As soon as I put it on I was getting the color. And the smell wasn't bad at all. It says to dry completely before you put your clothes back on and to wait 2-3 hours before you get your final color. The 3rd hour came and gone and I could barely tell any difference at all. So I decided to sleep with it on. Got up the next morning and took a shower. The water was Orange and it was so greasy. Took forever for that part to go away. When I got out I looked at my toes and streaks everywhere! I rubbed it off with the towel thinking Itwouldn't come off and I was about to be stuck with orange streaked toes. It came right off. I looked it the mirror to see what my body looked like and OMG orange and streaks all over!!!!! If I could put a pic. on here and show you I would. white spots everywhere. I would not use this again and would not want my friends to look like this.,WISH IT WAS RETURNABLE,,,An anonymous customer,79656007800,805,421

No more weird pink tinges and foundation masks after I found this product! I'm used to spending 50 for fancy department store foundation but now I can buy Iman's foundation stick in Sand 3 for less than 15 for practically the same quality and coverage. It is easy to apply: rub some of the stick onto your first three fingertips on one hand, then rub your finger tips together with opposite hand to warm the foundation a bit so it will blend easier on the face. Pat lightly onto parts of face you want the most coverage (for me, my T-zone and around the mouth/chin) then blend into the rest of face. I've had no bad reactions nor break outs with this product either. The reason why my title says Almost Perfect is because there are is a downside I have experienced with this foundation...there is transferring even when I use powder and MAC fix+ to set. I noticed they use added minerals, basically making this a type of mineral make-up and my skin does not go well with mineral make-up. The foundation tends to sit on my face and if I am not careful, I will leave make-up stains on clothing and objects. This is avoidable by not rubbing your face on stuff. If this foundation stick could stick to my skin and nowhere else, then this would be my holy grail. However, for the price, color-match, and blend-ability, it is definitely a keeper!",Almost Perfect!,,,An anonymous customer,7.88041E+11,805,421

I am so sad that even after knowing about this product for about a year, I never tried it until now. I was not disappointed! This is one of the best products I have ever added to my makeup routine! I have extremely pale, sensitive, and dry skin. I am very prone to acne and rashes both. I get many different kinds of pimples, including cystic acne and am in the process of finding out whether I have Lupus, which can include extreme inflammation on the face along with many other serious problems. Because of this, finding any kind of skin product that works for me is all but impossible. No matter what I did before products always faded, balled up, made my skin worse, or made my skin flake, etc. and I constantly had to change my routines up and completely reapply all my makeup after ever 4 or 5 hours...UNTIL NOW! The Translucent powder is absolutely perfect for my skin tone and provides smooth, matte coverage all over my face without caking up! It helps keep my foundation and concealer in place day long and wears well. Although I don't normally need to do quick fixes, this powder also does amazing when I touch up the concealer on some of my more stubborn blemishes. The only downside to this product is the smell, but I personally don't have a big problem with it and almost enjoy it because it reminds me of my mother's makeup when I was a kid and when I first started wearing makeup as a young teenager. I must also say that with all of my skin problems, I came at this product skeptically. But when I had one great skin day after another using this, my confidence boosted a lot! I literally sat in front of my vanity and cried one evening when I went to take off my makeup because of how happy this product makes me!",Game Changer!,,,Megan,"31,655,131,016,031,600,000,000",10598,8

It is the best undereye cover..no caking, light, moisturizing, and luminous. I keep 2...fair for under eyes and light for face. I haven't tried the actual larger face concealer/makeup, bcause this works perfect for quick touchups wthout makeup and also with my powder foundation. I have tried nearly every concealer...from cover girl, chanel, mac, etc etc...I hv tubes and bottles used a few times, but once I found this, I cont to buy it and never let myself run out. I still use cover girl light wth the stick sponge on occasion on face with full makeup, but never go without this eye concealer... daily. I will eventually try the larger makeup/concealer, but so happy with this for now...and hv been since shortly after it came out when my bf messed up(at least 2-4yrs...so long I can't remember)...I will try soon, but will keep my fair and light staples. I just hope the large ones are the exact same formula and staying power, color as the eye concealer. I would have 3 must haves then! If u lk a great, lasting, non creasing concealer with on point blendable color that is not waterproof...but it has staying power, maybe one touch up a day...you will undoubtedly have no regrets for trying it. 1/4-1/2 price of even comparable concealers (Chanel, Mac, kat von d, etc) with light feel so no weigh down or creases...def worth a try!! I rarely write reviews...by rarely, I mean MAYBE one a year at most...a product has to really impress me. And this one absolutely did... plan to have in my routine, and mults for bathroom, purse, locker room, etc for as long as this product is around...hope a LONG TIME. I will review the large version as well when try it bcause Im sure I'm not the only one curious how well this works in comparison. I may buy today jst bcause I really want to try it now and have to run to store... so stay tuned...:)",Best concealer at amazing price!,,,An anonymous customer,41554259247,805,421

This mirror is very bright white lighting. It's modern looking and the magnification is perfect. So much better and I'm very pleased. The only gripe I have is the screws that attach to the base have to be removed to wall mount it and the company had screwed the screws on sooooo tight, we almost stripped the screws trying to take them off. I honestly have no idea why they would attach them so tightly since they do have to be removed to wall mount it but we almost gave up and returned it. Finally my son (27 years old) was able to get the screws out (there's 3) without stripping them but it did take him quite awhile of working on it.

What a mess, everything healed up well but left nasty scars like road rash. Not even heavy foundation was working, you could still see the scaring. After searching the Internet and trying several products I found reviews for this product. Braving a snow storm, I emediately drove to the closest store that carried it. Seriously! The second day I saw a difference! I have been using it for 5 days now and the scaring hardly noticeable. Even my freckles have faded. My skin hasn't been this smooth and firm in years. A light coat of foundation and I look great. For the price you can't loose. Just wished it came in a bigger tube. My next question would be what other products should I use to go with the corrector I was thinking about trying the eye firming cream and would also like to try a moisturizer as well as.

The Tide Pods gave my white jeans purple spots all over them. I rewashed them without detergent and the spots came out but that is more cost to me for having to run the washer/dryer again. They also leave a white residue on clothes that I ended up having to scrub off by hand, which was time consuming. We have 5 teenagers and started using the Pods due to getting tired of cleaning up detergent that was spilled. Looks like we're going back to cleaning up detergent.

I appreciate the thought which went in to this new delivery mechanism for laundry cleaning agents, however they don't work for me in their current state of development. The main positive is that the cleaning power and the results are what I would expect of a Tide product. The negatives are 1) using cold water in an HE washer, I find the pods not dissolving as quickly as expected, thereby lessening the time the agents are in contact with the clothes, 2) the Mountain Spring scent impresses me of citrus and bubblegum, not at all like the Mountain scent of regular Tide liquid, 3) almost all of my washes are multiple, small loads because I live alone and this strikes me as a waste of the pods, which can handle large loads (perhaps a mini-pod version might be offered, however people might just try to use them on large loads, anyway, and then complain about insufficient cleaning). For now, I'll stick with Tide Totalclean, which is the best overall product for cleaning and softening clothing that I have ever used.","Novel idea, but with caveats",,,Dave,37000138822,4020,9

I had reservations with the price of the proprietary refill solution and the disposable cleaning pads. I was desperate, since we just moved to a townhouse with hardwood floors on entire lower level and we have two small dogs that track in dirt and mud leaving my new floors looking awful. I saw this mop and immediately thought FINALLY! No disposable cleaning pads and no expensive chemicals! I always wipe up large messes first (or spot spray with pre-mixed solution and let it sit for a few minutes), use my Dyson to clean up all debris and then I use this mop to surface clean. I use a small amount of PineSol and hot water and this mop does wonders on the hardwood and also the tile in the bathrooms!!! I do wish that it had an automatic spray. Continuously using the spray trigger makes my hand cramp. If it is not in a more upright position it will spray rather haphazardly. I am not very tall (5'6) and it is kind of awkward using the spray trigger in this position. The large mop head covers a large area making cleaning the floors a quick chore. It has a small profile and stores away easily. I rinse out the cleaning solution after a couple uses to avoid clogging the spray nozzles. I have read some reviews that the mop broke. Mine does not seem to have any issues yet but it is not intended to scrub your floors! If you use this product as intended it work GREAT!!",Great Purchase!,,,An anonymous customer,71691434580,805,421

They only lasted about two days so I would probably only use these if I needed a quick fix for an event or special occasion. I got them in the medium length but if I were to buy these on my own I would look for the shorter ones because I had to file these down a lot. The biggest problem I had though was finding nails to fit each finger which was a bummer because I was only able to get one manicure out of it vs two I have small hands so that may not be an issue for everyone. Overall they are good for what they are and if I needed a manicure but didn't have the time I would look into these again.,Good in a pinch,,,An anonymous customer,7.3151E+11,805,421

The glue was not that easy and making a mess by applying to much was simple. But, once I did a few, the rest came out much better. In terms of longevity, they say you should remove them at 7 days. But I'm not sure I'll have any left on by then. I lost 2 on day 4 and reglued the first one that fell off before giving up once a second did. I thought that I was being careful with them to make them last the 7 days, but it just didn't work out. I've since loosened the edges of the remaining nails in hopes that I don't need the fancy remover. And so far they have been coming off on their own.

regularly use Opti-Free Refresh but bought the Opti-Free Puremoist because the store was out of my regular solution. This solution causes my contacts to gunk up really quickly! I was having to take them out several times a day to rub them clean and rinse them off. I thought it was my eyes for several days and just switched to glasses. Absolutely no problem with my glasses. Next I switched to a fresh pair of contacts. The same problem occurred within hours. It was bad enough that my vision seemed to have changed. As a last ditch effort, I went to the pharmacy bought a bottle of my regular Opti-Free Replenish. Cleaned my contacts, let them soak for a bit rinsed them off. It took a few cycles of rinsing, but after that there were no more problems. I will never use the Puremoist again. An expensive lesson because I cannot find the receipt. I trusted the brand and never thought there would be such a severe problem switching from one version to a supposedly better version. I'm very disappointed with the Puremoist. On the other hand, I'm very happy with the Replenish.",Gunks up my contacts,,,Kelly,"300650361040,631113253665,300650193108,300650361033,400134000233,300650192293,300650192316,300650285445,191565925720,300653144503,191565986288,191566953494,191565301357,191565955529,300653144497,300650356107,300650356046,300650356053,300650361057,300651356380,300650180023,300650356350",8239,5
